## Self-Training

If you are a beginner and want to build custom apps with Frappe Framework, you are at the right place. You can start by watching the latest [recorded training sessions](/handouts/recordings) and get hands-on practice with the assignments that follow.

I would recommend you to do the corresponding assignment as soon as you finish watching a session. So, Day 1 assignment after Day 1 training and so on.
