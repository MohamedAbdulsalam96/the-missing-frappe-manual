Now that you are done with all the assignments, it is time to prepare for evaluations and get **that shiny certificate**!

:::danger[Important Note]
You must complete all the assignments and apply for evaluation **within 45 days** of the last day of the training. After this, no evaluation requests will be entertained unless a genuine reason is provided.

### Prerequisites For Apply For Evaluations

You must have passed the first 3 assignments and submitted the final open-ended assignment (Day 4) in order to proceed with the evaluation.

### When To Apply For Evaluations

The sooner, the better. But make sure you have practiced enough and are confident with all the topics mentioned in the syllabus (check the schedule page) so that you don't have to go through multiple rounds of evaluation ðŸ˜‰

### How To Apply For Evaluations

Visit the enrolled batches page on frappe.school, select your batch, and click on schedule evaluation button:

:::tip[For Partner Members]
Please drop an email to <sayali@frappe.io> to schedule an evaluation.

### The Evaluation Call

This will be a 1-on-1 Google Meet call with the evaluation (usually 45-60 minutes), where the evaluator will start by discussing your final assignment, and then moving to asking you questions one by one.

:::danger[Important Note]
If you don't pass your evaluation in the first call, you will get a second (and final) chance to prepare again and re-apply for evaluation. You can ask for the list of topics you were not confident in (which will help you prepare), from the evaluator if not provided.

### What Type Of Questions?

This can be simple questions like:

* What is the field in the backend that tells you about the submission state of a submittable doctype?
* What is the difference between a script and query report?

And questions to test that you know how some stuff works behind the scenes in Frappe Framework:

* Can you open up MariaDB console and write a SQL query to get all the fields and values of the **System Settings** DocType?
* How are child tables linked to their parent?

> Make sure you have gone through all the essential readings and viewings linked in the handouts!

### Certificate Release

Once you pass the evaluation(s), we will release the certificate in a day or two and you will become a Certified Frappe Developer! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### FAQs

1. What if I don't pass in the first evaluation call?

Answer: We will share the list of topics that you were not confident about and ask you to prepare those. Once you are ready with those topics, you can apply for another round of evaluation.
